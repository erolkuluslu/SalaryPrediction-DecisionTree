## Unveiling the Path to \$100k: A Formal Exploration with Decision Trees

This project presents a formal investigation into the potential of decision trees to predict individuals' eligibility for six-figure salaries. Driven by a desire to understand the complex factors influencing high-earning careers, this research employs anonymized data from various fields to develop a predictive model.

**Motivation:**

The ever-growing income gap has sparked fascination with the determinants of high-earning professionals. This project aims to shed light on these factors, empowering individuals with data-driven insights into career choices and companies with improved talent identification strategies.

**Methodology:**

- **Data Acquisition:** Anonymized datasets including company, job title, education level, and salary exceeding \$100k were acquired and preprocessed.
- **Model Development:** Utilizing the **Scikit-learn** library, a decision tree model was constructed based on the acquired data. This model employs a series of logical branches, analyzing specific features to predict whether an individual's salary exceeds the aforementioned threshold.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics, providing an objective assessment of its predictive capabilities.

**Key Findings:**

- The decision tree model demonstrates promising accuracy in predicting six-figure salaries based on readily available data points.
- The analysis provides valuable insights into the relative importance of various factors, such as company size, job specialization, and educational attainment, in influencing earning potential.

**Potential Applications:**

- **Career Guidance:** Individuals can utilize the model's predictions to gain informed insights into potential salary ranges for different career paths.
- **Recruitment Strategies:** Companies can leverage the model to identify promising candidates with high earning potential, streamlining the recruitment process.
- **Salary Negotiation:** The model's data-backed predictions can serve as a foundation for informed salary negotiations.

**Future Directions:**

- Refining the model by incorporating additional data points and exploring alternative algorithms.
- Investigating the ethical implications of utilizing such models in recruitment and talent management practices.
- Developing interactive tools for individuals and companies to access the model's insights and apply them to their specific needs.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of decision trees in analyzing complex datasets and generating meaningful predictions in the context of salary estimation. Future research will focus on further refining the model, exploring its broader applications, and addressing the ethical considerations associated with its use.
